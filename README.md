# The-Dao-Testament
I have discovered that the God described in the Bible and the Dao (the Way) described in the Tao Te Ching describe the same existence. God is omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent. All people are created by God and have an inseparable connection with God. However, everyone sees God differently, and each view is incomplete.

The Bible should not monopolize the right to interpret God. To do so is a blasphemy against God.

Therefore, I have translated the Tao Te Ching using Biblical concepts, to let the world see the God that the Chinese people see.
