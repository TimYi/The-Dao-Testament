The true face of God cannot be described in words, just as His name cannot be defined. That which is beyond name and form, the unspoken "Non-Being," is the origin from which all things arise. And when He reveals Himself as "Being," He becomes the mother who gives birth to all creation. Thus, when one lays aside all selfish desires, one may glimpse His mystery; when one seeks with a searching heart, one may behold the boundaries of His creation. This "Being" and "Non-Being" spring from the same source—they differ only in name, yet point to the same Most High. This truth, deep and ever deeper, is the path that leads to all mysteries.
