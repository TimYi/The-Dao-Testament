Set not the wise on high, lest the people strive. Prize not rare treasures, lest the people steal. Display not desirable things, lest the people's hearts be troubled.

Therefore the governance of the Saint is this: He empties their hearts of pride and fills their bellies; He weakens their self-will and strengthens their frame.

Thus He keeps the people from leaning on their own knowledge and from following their own desires, so that even the cunning dare not act.

When the Saint refrains from forcing his own ways, then all under heaven is ordered of itself.
