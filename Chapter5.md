The Lord oversees heaven and earth, showing no partiality, regarding all people as sheep in the pasture. The one who is wise in God acts according to the Father’s will, also showing no partiality, caring for all as a shepherd does his flock. Are not the Lord’s works like a bellows? Seemingly empty, yet never exhausted; once set in motion, grace increases all the more. To seek much knowledge and wisdom only leads to weariness and distress; it is better to fix your eyes on Christ and find true rest in Him.
