The highest good is like unto water. Water profiteth all things, yet remaineth still; it dwelleth in low places which men despise, therefore it is nigh unto the nature of God. In dwelling, be humble as water; in heart, be deep as water; in giving, be just as heaven; in word, be faithful as water; in governance, be clear as water; in works, be adaptable as water; in action, be timely as water. For it contendeth not, therefore it is without blame.
