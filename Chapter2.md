When the world agrees on a single standard for "beauty," ugliness is born. When all claim to possess "goodness," injustice itself arises. Being and non-being give rise to each other; difficulty and ease complete one another. Long and short are known only in contrast; high and low are defined in relation. Notes harmonize to create music; before and after follow to form sequence. This is the eternal law.

Therefore, the Perfect One acts without forcing His own will and teaches without relying on empty words. He lets all things unfold according to their nature, without interference; He sustains all creation, yet claims no credit; His work is accomplished, yet He takes no glory. Precisely because He does not claim it, the accomplishment and glory never depart from Him.
